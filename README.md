# SICXE-assembler
This is my take on creating an assembler for the SIC/XE architecture

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:
This project was by me for a college project, it can but is not intended to be used as an actual assembler.
The code design is intended to target specific individuals, so some functions may not be totally clear for all individuals.
Not all comments are particularly useful, they were added to meet a specific request.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am open to any kind of questions or suggestions.
